                <h1>Culture of America</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>America has an extremely unique culture. Basically, a long time ago, families from other countries around the world moved here for whatever reason and jumped into a huge melting pot. All the cultures got mashed together and somehow produced a much stranger one, which we call American culture.</p>
                <p>Because of this, Americans have many traits independent of other cultures. For example, Americans are extremely attached to their phones and will do anything to keep their phones near them. In fact, it is common legend that if an American is separated from his/her phone for more than 24 hours, that person will suffer from
                    <abbr title="extreme loneliness">lonelyitis</abbr>
                and die shortly thereafter.</p>
                <p>Americans are also more susceptible to social diseases, stereotypes and prejudices. For example, they are known for their long and pointless wars, riots, uprisings and anarchy about racism and sexism.</p>
