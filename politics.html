                <hr>
                <p>America has one of the most advanced political systems in the whole universe. Here's the gist of it:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A bunch of Americans hoping to become president give long and exasperating lectures about all the things they promise to [never] do once they become president.</li>
                    <li>On a very special day, all Americans 18 and up rush to their local voting polls to seclude themselves in a claustrophobic box where they cast their votes.</li>
                    <li>The people's votes don't actually matter, because someone else votes for them. On one overdramatic night, the votes are counted and the new president struggles not to burst out with ecstasy.</li>
                    <li>Half the country tries to beat up the other half because they didn't get the president they wanted. A third of the things the president said come true, a third don't and the last third totally backfire.</li>
                    <li>Americans are stuck with their new president for four years, having to deal with all the blunders he/she makes. After which, they fight over a new president.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>One such presidental candidate was a man by the name of Donald Trump, known for his moving speeches about love, socioeconomic equality, pacifism and butterflies.</p>
