                <h1>Politics of America</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>America has one of the most advanced political systems in the whole universe. Here's how it works:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A bunch of donkeys and elephants hoping to become president give long and exasperating lectures about all the things they promise to [kind of] do once they become president.</li>
                    <li>On a very special day, Americans stampede to their local voting polls to seclude themselves in a claustrophobic box where they cast their votes.</li>
                    <li>Plot twist! The people's votes don't really matter, because someone else votes for them. On one dramatic night, the votes are counted and either the donkey or the elephant becomes president.</li>
                    <li>Half the country tries to beat up the other half because they either wanted a donkey or an elephant as president.
                    <li>The president does some of the things he/she promised but mostly slacks off. If the president is bored, he/she will go start some random war for no reason, like the Vietnam War or the Iraq War.</li>
                    <li>Some Americans have a revelation and forget why they would even vote for this incompetent president. Sadly for them, they're stuck with this president for four years. Afterwards, the cycle repeats itself, and Americans fight over more donkeys and elephants.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>One such presidential candidate was a man by the name of Donald
                    <abbr title="Trump">Drumpf</abbr>,
                known for his moving speeches about love, socioeconomic equality, pacifism and butterflies.</p>
